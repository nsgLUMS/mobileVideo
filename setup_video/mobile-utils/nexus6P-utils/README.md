# Nexus 6P Utilities

These are small scripts that are used to perform operations on Nexus 6P by automated experimental scripts. These scripts use adb shell commands to interact with the device.

Please place the memory pressure app and Firefox app on the home screen of the device and edit the first tap's coordinates in `set_up_memory_pressure_app.sh` and `ready_firefox.sh` to match the coordinates of the location of the apps on the home screen.
