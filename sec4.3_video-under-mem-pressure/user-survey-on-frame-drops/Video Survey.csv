6/23/2021 21:13:36,Yes,Male,21,1,1,4,Very Very laggy and jittery. Seems like the video FPS are very low. Not  comfortable to watch at all.
6/23/2021 21:21:12,Yes,Male,20,4,1,1,"Video 2 was very jittery and the pauses felt more and more annoying as the video progresses and so watching it became increasingly frustrating, same feeling as trying to watch a movie online on a bad internet connection"
6/23/2021 21:22:50,Yes,Male,21,4,1,1,Video 2 had lots of extremely annoying jitters and it hurt when I tried to focus on the scene and on what was actually going on in the video.
6/23/2021 21:25:04,Yes,Male,21,4,2,2,Video 2 is a bit laggy. There were pauses in between. I feel picture quality is also compromised in video 2 compared to video 1.
6/23/2021 21:31:11,Yes,Male,21,2,1,1,"Both videos had evident lags. For some reason, resolution of video 2 looked better than video 1 but the lag was greater causing greater distraction. "
6/23/2021 21:33:14,Yes,Male,22,3,2,2,"In video 2 there was more stuttering. Moreover, in video 2 there were some frames which would stop for a couple of second completely."
6/23/2021 21:41:35,Yes,Male,22,2,1,2,"Video 2 had significantly larger video pauses, jitter than video 1 which was very annoying. Video 1 also had noticeable lag and jitter as well, but it was watchable."

6/23/2021 21:51:16,Yes,Male,22,3,2,2,"First video on its own without watching the second seemed of low quality, as well as a little choppy (not completely smooth as you'd expect in a YouTube video). However, the second video was much more jittery, dropping a lot of frames and it was difficult to even follow what was going on since at one point there were just flashing images and no motion because of how jittery it was. 

In comparison, both videos were of low quality but the differential in terms of quality was not noticeable. However, in terms of smoothness, the first video was much better than the second one, but still, not high quality and neither as smooth as it should normally be for streaming."

6/23/2021 22:32:32,Yes,Female,24,4,1,1,
6/23/2021 22:39:47,Yes,Female,21,5,1,1,"Pauses were more prominent in video 2 than in video 1, making video 2 look like as if a video is being stuck due to internet connection issue when in fact it was programmed to be this way. The Experience with Video 2 wasn't good at all. Video 1 was far better than in 2 "

6/24/2021 0:10:58,Yes,Male,21,4,3,4,I felt the quality (pixel wise was same) buy the overall quality gap due to pauses was noticeable. However the context of the video was still there and I did not lose my focus because of it and was thus able to follow through 
6/24/2021 0:17:49,Yes,Female,21,3,2,2,Both videos were not clear and were not smooth in terms of flow. The quality was very low as the videos looked very pixelated.

6/24/2021 18:11:27,Yes,Female,20,4,2,2,Video 2 was similar to the glitchy picture-slideshow kind of video in zoom screen share. Video 1 was not great either but a bit better maybe.
