# System-level Trace Analysis through Perfetto

## Experimental Setup

We ran video under synthetic memory pressure the same way we did in ยง4.3. However, during video playback we recorded system traces through Perfetto.

## Recording traces through Perfetto

We used the [Perfetto UI](https://ui.perfetto.dev/#!/record) to get the command to record traces on the device's shell. We used the following exact steps/commands to record out trace.

- Open the Linux terminal and type the following to open the device shell
    ```
    adb shell
    ```
- Run the following on the device's shell to record the Perfetto trace
    ```
    perfetto \
    -c - --txt \
    -o /data/misc/perfetto-traces/trace_c202 \

## Our Recorded Traces

The Perfetto traces that we recorded and use in our analysis are present in `./traces`.

## Our Analysis

- `./time_spent_analysis` contains instructions/code/data to reproduce our measurements of the time spent by kswapd, video client processes in different processor states.
- `./preemption_analysis` contains instructions/code/data to reproduce our mmcqd and kswapd preemption analysis.
